Super Moooooosome!  You have just setup a NodeJS FrontEnd Dev Environment!

But that was a bit verbose to start up the server and all of that the 
watching, etc.  This is just the beginning, more tutorials are coming!  
If you have suggestions tweet them to @codingcow!

Thank You, I hope this was short and informative!  We want to do 
better, so the more feedback the better!

Have a great day!
