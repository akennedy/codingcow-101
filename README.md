# Coding Cow Presents

# Browserify and Beefy - Getting Started

To run the tutorial yourself, make sure you have cowsay installed and available:

```
echo 'Hello World' | cowsay
```

This command should show a cow with a bubble.

```
 _____________
< Hello World >
 -------------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||

```

To work through the tutorial, all you should have to do is to clone this project cd into it and type:

```
./n
```

> Then do what the cow says!

Enjoy!
